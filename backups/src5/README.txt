stuff to fix:
- a cluster of bubbles that is isolated after a clearing the bubbles holding it should be cleared
- sometimes the bubbles don't want to get destroyed, although they are 3 or 4. Look into that...
- the colors in the cannon and spare bubble should only be one of those that exist on the board
fixed:
- left wall bug (notice that the slope of the line drawn switches between negative and positive..)
    *fixnote: just increased startx by 3 pixels
