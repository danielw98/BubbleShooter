## Installation and Running
Ensure SDL2, SDL2_image, SDL2_ttf, and SDL2_mixer are installed on your system. Clone the repository, compile using the provided Makefile, and run the game:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/danielw98/BubbleShooter.git
cd BubbleShooter
make
./BubbleShooter
```

## Gameplay Mechanics
- Aim and shoot bubbles to form groups of three or more of the same color to clear them from the board.
- Clearing combos causes all unconnected bubbles to fall, not just the matched ones, adding a satisfying twist to the gameplay.
- Progress through the levels by clearing all bubbles before time runs out.

## Files and Architecture
The game's logic is spread across multiple files, with `game.cpp` serving as the heart of the game, `levelmanager.cpp` for managing levels, and `matchfinding.cpp` for handling bubble matching logic. Singleton classes like `TextureManager`, `SoundManager`, and `FontRenderer` are used for efficient resource management.
